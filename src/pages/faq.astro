    question: "What is LinkMe?",
    answer: "LinkMe is a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platform that helps you connect with people you meet in real life or through professional exchanges (e.g., email, Slack). It offers digital business cards, contact management tools, and automation features to build and maintain meaningful professional relationships. LinkMe is available on the Apple App Store for iOS devices and as a web application at <a href='https://getlinkme.io' class='text-indigo-600 dark:text-indigo-400 hover:underline'>getlinkme.io</a> and <a href='https://app.getlinkme.io' class='text-indigo-600 dark:text-indigo-400 hover:underline'>app.getlinkme.io</a>."
  },
  {
    question: "How does LinkMe differ from LinkedIn?",
    answer: "Unlike LinkedIn, which can feel superficial, LinkMe focuses on authentic, meaningful connections. You can share curated details like a 15-second voice intro, a micro-story about a recent project, or a collaboration goal. LinkMe also offers seamless contact exchange via QR codes or NFC, contextual note-taking, and AI-driven follow-up suggestions to foster deeper relationships."
  },
  {
    question: "What features are included in the free tier?",
    answer: "The free tier of LinkMe includes basic digital business card creation, contact management with tagging and search, and one-click sharing via QR codes or links. Note that by using the free tier, you consent to LinkMe accessing your data to provide and improve the service, as outlined in our <a href='/privacy' class='text-indigo-600 dark:text-indigo-400 hover:underline'>Privacy Policy</a>."
  },

  },
  {
    question: "How do I share my digital business card?",
    answer: "You can share your digital business card instantly using QR codes, NFC taps (on compatible devices), or direct links. Simply open the LinkMe app or web application, navigate to your profile, and select your preferred sharing method. Recipients can view your card and save your contact details without needing a LinkMe account."
  },
  {
    question: "What are Smart Profiles and how do they work?",
    answer: "Smart Profiles are dynamic digital business cards that evolve over time. You can add a 'Current Focus' section that auto-expires after 30 days, keeping your profile fresh. You can also include a voice intro, micro-story, or collaboration goal to make your profile more personal and engaging."
  },
