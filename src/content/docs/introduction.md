## Why We Built LinkMe

We created LinkMe to solve common networking challenges:

1. **The Business Card Problem**: Traditional cards get lost, and manually entering contact information is tedious. Digital solutions often lack context about the relationship.

2. **The Follow-Up Gap**: It's hard to keep track of who you've met and when to follow up, leading to missed opportunities and forgotten connections.

3. **Network Blindness**: Most professionals don't fully understand the potential within their existing network or how to leverage it effectively.

4. **Meaningful Connections**: Many networking platforms prioritize quantity over quality, making it difficult to build authentic professional relationships.

LinkMe addresses these challenges with a human-centered approach to networking that combines innovative technology with principles of authentic relationship building.
